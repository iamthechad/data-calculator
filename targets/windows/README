The files in this location can be used to create a Windows installer.

NSIS must be installed for the installer creation to be successful. NSIS can be downloaded from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/.
The build script relies on the NSIS Ant Task, available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsisant/.
Running the build script against the "all" target will generate setup.exe.
